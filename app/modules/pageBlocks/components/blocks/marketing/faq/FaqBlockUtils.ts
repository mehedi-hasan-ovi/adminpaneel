      question: "How do I get the code after purchasing?",
      answer:
        "You will be invited to the saasrock-core repository on GitHub. If you bought SaasRock Enterprise you will also be invited to the saasrock-enterprise repository.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will there be updates every month?",
      answer: "No, I can't guarantee that, but I'll try. What you can do is pausing your subscription and come back when you see a shiny new feature.",
    },
    {
      question: "Can I get a refund?",
      answer: "Due to the nature of software development being a custom service, we do not offer refunds.",
    },
    {
      question: "Is it really a perpetual license for unlimited websites?",
      answer:
        "Yes, you don't need a subscription to use SaasRock for your SaaS app development. Subscription is only required to get access to the private repository to get updates.",
    },
    {
      question: "Will I still get updates after my subscription expires?",
      answer: "No, you could subscribe again to get the latest updates.",
    },
    {
      question: "What is a developer license?",
      answer:
        "A developer license is a license for a developer to use SaasRock for their own SaaS app development. If you need a license for your team, buy all the licenses you need.",
